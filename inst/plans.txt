# Project Objectives

1. Making LaTeX templates for the two ISLS journals (i.e., JLS; ijCSCL) and two conferences (i.e., CSCL; ICLS).
2. Developing R package, called "ISLS," to provide the ISLS members with reproducible research using R markdown (hereafter, Rmd) for the two journals and two conferences mentioned above.

# Plans

## Step 1: LaTeX

Creating LaTeX templates for each of the four manuscripts following their author guidelines in the order below:

1. [JLS](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?show=instructions&journalCode=hlns20)
2. [ijCSCL](http://ijcscl.org/?go=authors)
3. [ICLS](https://icls2018.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/1/2/49120569/isls_author_guidelines_oct2014.pdf)
4. CSCL: Need to find the guidelines.

## Step 2: Rmd

Developing Rmd template files for each of the four manuscripts based on the LaTeX template created in the Step 1 in the order below:

1. JLS
2. ijCSCL
3. ICLS
4. CSCL

## Step3: Testing

Having a beta and alpha test the LaTeX and Rmd (ISLS R package) with the ISLS members and get constructive feedback for improvement.

## Step4: Submission

1. CRAN submission

  As an independent R package called "ISLS": we can add more functions in the future for LS-specific needs going beyond the manuscript template. For example, sentimental dictionary based on LS literature, etc. etc.

2. rticles Contribution

  We can send our completed Rmd template along with its LaTeX base to rticles project team to publicly include ISLS templates for their project.
